=head1 NAME

WWW::Metaweb - An interface to the Metaweb database via MQL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use WWW::Metaweb;

  my $mh = WWW::Metaweb->connect( username => $u,
				  password => $p, 
				  server => 'www.freebase.com',
				  auth_uri => '/api/account/login',
				  read_uri => '/api/service/mqlread',
				  write_uri => '/api/service/mqlwrite',
				  trans_uri => '/api/trans',
				  pretty_json => 1 );

  my $query = {
	  '/type/object/creator' => undef,
	  cover_appearances => [{
	    type => '/comic_books/comic_book_issue',
	    name => undef,
	    part_of_series => undef
	  }],
	  created_by => [],
	  id => undef,
	  name => 'Nico Minoru',
	  type => '/comic_books/comic_book_character'
  };

The easy way:

  my $result = $mh->read($query, 'json');
  print $result;

The complicated way:

  $mh->add_query('read', $query);
  $mh->send_envelope('read')
    or die $WWW::Metaweb::errstr;

  my $result = $mh->result('read', 'json');
  print $result . "\n";

=head1 ABSTRACT

WWW::Metaweb provides an interface to a Metaweb database through it's HTTP API and MQL.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WWW::Metaweb provides an interface to a Metaweb database instance. The best example currently is Freebase (www.freebase.com). Queries to a Metaweb are made through HTTP requests to the Metaweb API.

Qeueries are written in the Metaweb Query Language (MQL), using Javascript Object Notation (JSON). WWW::Metaweb allows you to write the actual JSON string yourself or provide a Perl array ref / hash ref structure to be converted to JSON.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Class methods

=over

=item B<< $version = WWW::Metaweb->version >>

Returns the version of WWW::Metaweb being used.

=back

=cut

sub version  {
	return $WWW::Metaweb::VERSION;
} # ->version

=head2 Constructors

=over

=item B<< $mh = WWW::Metaweb->connect( [option_key => 'option_value' ...] ) >>

Returns a new WWW::Metaweb instance, a number of different attributes can be sethere (see below).

If a C<username> and C<password> are supplied then C<connect()> will attempt to authenticate before returning. If this authentication fails then C<undef> will be returned.

=over

=item B<< Metaweb parameters >>

=over

=item B<< auth_uri >>

The URI used to authenticate for this Metaweb (eg. /api/account/login).

=item B<< read_uri >>

The URI used to submit a read MQL query to this Metaweb (eg. /api/service/mqlread).

=item B<< write_uri >>

The URI used to submit a write MQL query to this Metaweb (eg. /api/service/mqlwrite).

=item B<< trans_uri >>

The URI used to access the translation service for this Metaweb (eg. /api/trans). Please note this this URI does not include the actual C<translation>, at this time these are C<raw>, C<image_thumb> and C<blurb>.

=back

=item B<< JSON parameters >>

=over

=item B<< pretty_json >>

Determines whether the response to a JSON query is formatted nicely. This is just passed along to the JSON object as C<JSON::XS->new->pretty($mh->{pretty})>.

=item B<< json_preprocessor >>

Can provide a reference to a sub-routine that pre-processes JSON queries, the sub-routine should expect one argument - the JSON query as a string and return the processed JSON query as a scalar.

=head2 Easy Querying

=over

=item B<< @results = $mh->read($read_query [, $read_query2 ...] [, $format]) >> or B<< $result = $mh->read($read_query [, $format]) >>

The easy way to perform a read query.

Accepts one or more queries which are bundled up in one envelope and sent to the read service. The response is an array containing the results in the same order as the queries were given in.

If only one query is given and assigned to a scaler then the single query will be returned as a scaler instead of in an array.

=head2 Translation Service

=over

=item B<< $content = $mh->trans($translation, $guid) >>

Gets the content for a C<guid> in the format specified by C<$translation>. Metaweb currently supports the translations C<raw>, C<image_thumb> and C<blurb>.

C<$translation> is not checked for validity, but an error will most likely be returned by the server.

C<$guid> should be the global identifier of a Metaweb object of type C</common/image> or C</type/content> and/or C</common/document> depending on the translation requested, if not the Metaweb will return an error. The global identifier can be prefixed with either a '#' or the URI escaped version '%23' then followed by the usual string of lower case hex.

=cut

sub trans  {
	my $self = shift;
	my $translation = shift;

=head2 Complicated Querying

=over

=item B<< $mh->add_query($method, query_name1 => $query1 [, query_name2 => $query2 [, ...]]) >>

This method adds queries to a query envelope. C<$method> must have a value of either 'read' or 'write'.

Each query must have a unique name, otherwise a new query will overwrite an old one. By the same token, if you wish to change a query in the query envelope, simply specify a new query with the old query name to overwrite the original.

A query may either be specified as a Perl structure, or as a JSON string. The first example below is a query as a Perl structure.

  $query_perl = {
	  name => "Nico Minoru",
	  id => undef,
	  type => [],
	  '/comic_books/comic_book_character/cover_appearances' => [{
		name => null  
	  }]
  };

The same query as a JSON string:

  $query_json = '
  {
	  "name":"Nico Minoru",
	  "id":null,
	  "type":[],
	  "/comic_books/comic_book_character/cover_appearances":[{
		  "name":null
	  }]
  }';

For the same of completeness this JSON query can be submitted the same way as in the query editor, a shortened version formatted like this is below:

  $query_json_ext = '
  {
	  "query":{
		  "name":"Nico Minoru",
		  "type":[]
	  }
  }';

Now we can add all three queries specified above to the envelope with one call.

  $mh->add_query( query_perl => $query_perl, query_json => $query_json, query_json_ext => $query_json_ext );

=cut

sub add_query  {

=head2 Query Convenience Methods (for complicated queries)

As most of the query and result methods require a C<$method> argument as the first parameter, I've included methods to call them for each method explicitly.

If you know that you will always be using a method call for either a read or a write query/result, then it's safer to user these methods as you'll get a compile time error if you spell read or write incorrectly (eg. a typo), rather than a run time error.

Of course it's probably much easier to just use C<read()> and C<write()> from the L<Easy Querying> section above.

if C<$query_name> is not defined then the default query name 'netmetawebquery' will be used instead.

If C<$format> is not specified then the result is returned in the format the original query was supplied.

Following the previous example, we have three separate results stored, so let's get each of them out.

  $result1 = $mh->result('query_perl');
  $result2 = $mh->result('query_json');
  $result3 = $mh->result('query_json_ext', 'perl');

The first two results will be returned in the format their matching queries were submitted in - Perl structure and JSON string respectively - the third will be returned as a Perl structure, as it has been explicitly asked for in that format.

Fetching a result does not effect it, so a result fetched in one format can be later fetched using another.

sub result  {
	my $self = shift;
	my $query_name = shift || 'netmetawebquery';
	my $format = shift;
	my $result;
	my $raw_result;
	my $perl_result;

	# If the query isn't okay - just return undef, errstr will have been set
	return undef unless $self->result_is_ok($query_name);

	# Check the return format if it hasn't been explicitly set.
	$format = $self->{result_format}->{$query_name} unless defined $format;
	
	$JSON::UnMapping = 1;
	$perl_result = decode_json($self->{result_envelope})->{$query_name}->{result};

	if ($format eq 'json')  {
		$result = JSON::XS->new->utf8->pretty($self->{pretty_json})->encode($perl_result);
	}
	else  {
		$result = $perl_result;
	}
	
	return $result;
} # ->result

=item B<< $text = $mh->raw_result >>

Returns the raw result from the last time an envelope was sent.

After a successful query this will most likely be a JSON structure consisting of the outer envelope with the code and status as well as a result for each query sent in the last batch.

After an unsuccessful query this will contain error messages detailing what went wrong as well as code and status sections to similar effect.

If the transaction itself failed then the returned text will probably be empty, but at the very least this method will always return an empty string, never C<undef>.

=head2 Accessors

=over

=item B<< $ua = $mh->useragent >> or B<< $mh->useragent($ua) >>

Gets or sets the LWP::UserAgent object which is used to communicate with the Metaweb. This method can be used to change the user agent settings (eg. C<$mh->useragent->timeout($seconds)>).

=cut

sub useragent  {
	my $self = shift;
	my $new_useragent = shift;

	$self->{ua} = $new_useragent if defined $new_useragent;

	return $self->{ua};
} # ->useragent

=item B<< $host = $mh->server >> or B<< $mh->server($new_host) >>

Gets or sets the host for this Metaweb (eg. www.freebase.com). No checking is currently done as to the validity of this host.

=cut

sub server  {
	my $self = shift;
	my $new_server = shift;
	
	$self->{server} = $new_server if defined $new_server;
	$self->{server} = 'http://'.$self->{server} unless $self->{server} =~ /^http:\/\//;

	return $self->{server};
} # ->server

=head1 BUGS AND TODO

Still very much in development. I'm waiting to hear from you.

There is not query syntax checking - the method exists, but doesn't actually do anything.

If authentication fails not much notice is given.

More information needs to be given when a query fails.

I would like to implement transparent cursors in read queries so a single query can fetch as many results as exist (rather than the standard 100 limit).

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

While entirely rewritten, I think it's only fair to mention that the basis for the core of this code is the Perl example on Freebase (http://www.freebase.com/view/helptopic?id=%239202a8c04000641f800000000544e139).

Michael Jones has also been a great help - pointing out implementation issues and providing suggested fixes and code.
