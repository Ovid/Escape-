=head1 NAME

Escape - Playing around with Catalyst and DBIx::Class.

=head1 PURPOSE

Long-term, this might be a Web site for people gather information about how to
emigrate to other countries.  Right now, it pretty much just lists countries
and Google maps for said countries.

=head1 THEFT

I stole the basic design from perldoc.perl.org.  Sue me :)  (Actually, JJ,
please don't sue me)

=head1 USAGE

Start the server

    ./script/escape_server.pl -r

There might be more in the future, but that's all it takes right now.
