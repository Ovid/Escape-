This list states the country names (official short names in English) in
alphabetical order as given in ISO 3166-1 and the corresponding ISO
3166-1-alpha-2 code elements. The list is updated whenever a change to the
official code list in ISO 3166-1 is effected by the ISO 3166/MA. It lists 246
official short names and code elements. One line of text contains one entry. A
country name and its code element are separated by a semicolon (;).
